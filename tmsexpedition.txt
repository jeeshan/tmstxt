       Introduction




                                                                                     ed
       Thanks to advances in brain stimulation, we can now test causal hypotheses by selectively

       applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to specific brain circuits1. These approaches




                                                                                  iew
       have been used to treat mental illnesses such as major depression and to modulate psychological

       processes (e.g. fear extinction)2 , neurological functions (e.g. motor rehabilitation)3, personality

       traits (e.g. hypnotizability)4, and even neurotransmitter function (e.g. NMDA-mediated




                                                                        ev
       plasticity)5. These results are the tip of the iceberg – many brain functions can likely be mapped,

       targeted, and causally modulated.




                                                             r
       Causal brain mapping can be conducted by randomly applying TMS to different targets and

       mapping the functional connectivity of targets that preferentially modify any given cluster of
                                                          er
       behaviors1. Our group piloted this approach using observational data on 111 patients receiving
                                               pe
       clinical TMS for depression. Treatment was targeted based on scalp measurements, leading to

       incidental inter-individual variability in TMS sites. Incidental stimulation of one circuit led to

       changes in “dysphoric” symptoms such as sadness and suicidality, while stimulation of a
                                     ot


       different circuit led to changes in “anxiosomatic” symptoms such as libido and worry6. However,

       these results were based on retrospective analysis of TMS sites that happen to be within regions
                          tn



       that are typically targeted for depression. This was subsequently validated in a prospective

       clinical trial showing that stimulation of these distinct targets can selectively modify anxiety
                rin




       independently of depression7. To test for other relevant circuits, our group recently applied a

       similar clustering approach, except using brain lesions (n=196) spanning the whole brain instead
     ep




       of TMS sites8. This yielded a third circuit for a third behavioral cluster, and connectivity to this

       third circuit independently predicted TMS outcomes for depression.

       prospectively randomize the TMS site and study changes in various transdiagnostic behaviors.

       To our knowledge, most prior causal brain mapping work has been based incidental variability in

       locations of TMS sites or other focal manipulations such as DBS or lesions. These retrospective

       natural experiments are useful but are not fully random, as several factors can bias these




                                                                        ev
       incidental distributions. For example, locations of TMS sites are biased by head size, which

       systematically differs by gender and ethnicity. Locations of DBS sites are biased by




                                                             r
       intraoperative testing results, which are systematically related to the symptom that is being

       treated. The locations of brain lesions are systematically biased by vascular distributions (in the

       case of stroke) or physical trajectories of external head trauma (e.g. projectiles to the amygdala

       must first pass through the anterolateral temporal lobe). Only prospective randomization can

       address these biases.

       Here, we will prospectively randomize across a large range of TMS targets. We can compare
                                     ot

       otherwise seem different from each other (Fig. 1). Most TMS clinical trials compare TMS to

       sham, but do not compare different targets to each other. As a result, they are not able to

       comment on the causal role of a specific brain circuit, as they cannot test for anatomical

       specificity. Even in the rare trials that compare two or more targets, the tests are biased by a prior

       model that influenced target selection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to attempt true

       randomization in which a TMS site is chosen without any prior assumptions about its function.

       emotional conflict resolution (r=0.33). This estimate is conservative because these effect sizes

       trials54, we will aim to recruit a total of 90 participants, aiming for 71 completers.


        This power analysis is also highly conservative because our study uses a crossover design with

       within-subjects analysis, which will greatly increase our power. Prospective randomization is

       also likely to increase our power by increasing variance in TMS targets beyond what can be seen

       Discussion




                                                                                     ed
       Biotyping efforts have correlated symptom clusters with specific circuits in symptomatic

       patients, but causality and therapeutic relevance remain unclear55. The present study will build a




                                                                                  iew
       multidimensional atlas of circuits that are causally involved in human brain function by

       randomly applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to different targets and mapping the

       functional connectivity of targets that preferentially modify any given behavior. If successful,




                                                                        ev
       this will yield a parsimonious model of circuits that are causally involved in different behaviors.

       Optimal personalized therapeutic targets for invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation can then




                                                             r
       be empirically tested in clinical trials. The atlas will contain maps that describe which tasks and

                                                          er
       questionnaires are measuring similar circuits, and which are measuring different circuits. This

       information can be used to generate future circuit-based hypotheses for biomarker development
                                               pe
       and other aspects of circuit-behavior integration.


       It remains unclear if TMS should be targeted based on diagnosis or transdiagnostic behaviors. By
                                      ot


       systematically collecting TMS targeting data along with a transdiagnostic behavioral assessment

       in patients with multiple diagnoses this study will test whether the effects of causal circuit
                          tn



       manipulation are better modeled using diagnostic categories, transdiagnostic traits, or a

       combination of both. If the effects of TMS are entirely diagnosis-dependent, then this study may
                rin




       be underpowered to detect an effect. However, this will be an important negative result that

       should inform future TMS targeting paradigms. It is also probable that some behaviors are TMS-
     ep




       responsive, while others are not. This will also be an important negative result to report and

       included in our final atlas.

        The final atlas resulting from this study will include (1) all the cluster-based circuit maps along




                                                                                         ed
       with the corresponding behavioral metrics in each cluster, and (2) all the individual circuit maps

       that survive multiple comparisons correction, along with a label of the cluster to which they




                                                                                      iew
       belong (if they fall into a cluster), (3) the circuit map associated with nonspecific TMS effects on

       mental illness, and (4) the diagnosis-specific circuit maps. For circuit maps that do not survive

       our rigorous permutation or cross-validation-based statistical hypothesis testing, they will be




                                                                           ev
       reported as negative results, along with effect sizes for use in future studies.


        This study is designed to quantitatively answer the controversial question of the added value of




                                                               r
       targeting in TMS clinical practice. All existing studies on this topic thus far have been

                                                            er
       retrospective or non-random, thus making it impossible to estimate the true effect. By

       prospectively randomizing the stimulation site, this study will enable TMS clinicians to advise
                                                 pe
       patients regarding how much additional benefit may be achieved with MRI guidance.

       Overall, this study will yield a dataset that can be used to test a practically infinite range of
                                      ot

       hypotheses about TMS targeting. In addition to the primary and secondary analyses described

       here, the resulting dataset will be made available to the research community to test creative
                          tn



       hypotheses about how targeting different circuits may affect different behaviors. If successful,

       this study will also provide a template via which brain circuits can be causally mapped across a
                rin




       wide range of settings in the future.
